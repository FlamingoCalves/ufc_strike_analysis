# UFC Fight Analysis Project

## Introduction
This repository contains an analysis of striking trends in UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) fights. The project aims to provide insights into how fighting strategies and outcomes differ across various weight classes and over the course of UFC history. 

## Methodology
The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset of UFC fights, including detailed fight records such as the number of significant strikes landed, weight classes, fight outcomes, and fighter statistics. The primary tools used for this analysis were Python and Plotly, which enabled detailed data processing, exploratory analysis, and interactive visualization.

## Key Findings
The project addressed several key questions, yielding intriguing findings:

1. **Striking Frequency by Weight Class**: A negative correlation was observed between striking frequency and weight class, with lighter weight classes striking more on average than heavier ones.
2. **Strikes and Fighter Records**: Fighters with lower win-loss records tend to get struck more, indicating that higher-level fighters typically absorb fewer strikes.
3. **Knockouts and Weight Classes**: Fewer strikes are generally required to knock out heavier fighters, likely due to the greater power behind strikes in heavier weight classes.
4. **Striking Trends Over Time**: An increase in the number of strikes thrown in UFC fights has been observed over the years, possibly influenced by the addition of female fighters, smaller weight classes, and evolving safety regulations.

## How to Use
To explore the analysis, you can view the Jupyter notebooks which include detailed code, commentary, and visualizations. The interactive plots are best viewed directly in the notebooks, as they provide an engaging way to understand the data.
